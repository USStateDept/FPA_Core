Node.JS REST API Server Boilerplate

What is it?
===============

This is a boilerplate / starting point for a REST API server.  The purpose of this is to give someone
a quick head start and a few conventions while creating a REST API.  There are many frameworks and tools
out there and this does not try to be any of them.  This simply provides some small conventions for a start of a project.

Setup
===============

1.  Download the files
2.  Run `npm install -d` to install all dependencies of the project
3.  Run `node app.js` to start the server
4.  Visit the following in your browser to see the example API's:


	http://localhost:8080/1/employees/1?secret_admin=boilerplatesRock

	http://localhost:8080/1/employees?secret_admin=boilerplatesRock

Overview
===============

The following are a few concepts you'll want to understand in this boilerplate:

## Configuration

There is a `/config.js` file in the root that you can use for some configuration of your project.  Currently,
the boilerplate takes in to account the following options:

	- port number
	- cache
	- cache duration
	- admin secret key (to get around the api_token/secret headers)

## Routing

The boilerplate uses Express, the most popular framework in the Node community for defining routes / API's, so any
routes you see here will be Express routes.

The boilerplate assumes you want to version your API.  In /routes.js is where you'll place the available API's
based on version.  v1 is already there for you to reference.  This will just bring in the v1/routes file and make
them ready in the Node.JS server.

Inside the v1/routes.js file is where you declare the normal Express routes, like you would with any other Express
app.  The convention assumes you will version your routes like so:  `:version/employees` e.g. `http://myserver/1/employees`

The example routes use the `validateToken` function.  This will check for the `api_token` and `api_secret` headers
and handle the response if they are incorrect or missing.  For now, simple token management is stubbed out for you via the `token.js` file.

## Model

The model file is a sample file the route will call to build the response data.  This can be where you place your
business logic, mashing data, etc.  Whatever suits your use case.

## API Documentation

The boilerplate uses [http://apidocjs.com/](http://apidocjs.com/) to generate REST API documentation.  As long
as you document your routes according to the apidocsjs.com spec, you can auto-gen the docs.  To view the documentation:

1.  Install APIDocs:  `npm install apidoc -g` (might need to use `sudo` of course)
2.  Run the command in your project folder:  `apidoc`
3.  There will be a new folder `doc`, open the index.html file to preview your docs

## File Structure

`app.js` - Bootstrap for the server.  Nothing much to see here

`config.js` - Server configuration

`core.js` - App-wide singleton for references to the express server and such.

`routes.js` - The routes the server is monitoring

`sampleDataSource.js` - This is just a stubbed out / mock data source to demonstrate some of the flow
of the routes and such.

`tokens.js` - Simple object with the approved tokens / secrets that are allowed to ping the API server.

`v1/` - Versioned API's go in folders like `v1`, `v2`, etc.

`v1/cache.js` - The caching module used in this version of the API.  This could probably be moved to more
of a global cache module but have it here for now.  The current cache module is simplistic, in-memory caching.
It's not meant to be for a lot of caching or production but rather an example of how a caching module
can work with the api's.

`v1/errorHandling.js` - All the error messages handled in the app go here.

`v1/model.js` - The boilerplate model the routes hit for data.

`v1/routes.js` - The routes defined for this version of the api.
