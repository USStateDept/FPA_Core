				strong Description

				| The F Interagency Network Databank (FIND) strives to enhance public access to and use of data 
				| that it collects and publishes.  The datasets are managed by the Office of U.S. Foreign 
				| Assistance (F) at the U.S. Department of State and its stakeholders that are provided in a 
				| number of machine-readable formats. F provides the data free of charge subject to the terms 
				| of this agreement.  Use of data derived from the Indicators, which may appear in formats such 
				| as tables and charts, is also subject to these terms.  
			p
				strong Comments
			p
				| We encourage you to share your suggestions and ideas for using or facilitating access to the 
				| Indicators with F by contacting us by email at FIND@state.gov.

				| interfaces (“APIs”) to facilitate access to the Datasets, whether through a separate Web site or 
				| through another type of software application.

				| sub-licenses of the data that you grant, and a requirement that any sub-licensees do the same.

				| of use.
